Gameplay
--------
Quest is an intelligent game application which knows your current location, and hence can generate mind bending quizzes for you to solve.

Your aim is simple: solve clues to know your next destination. Once you reach your destination, solve the very easy (wicked smile) puzzle to unlock the clues for the next destination.

Navigation

The game has SIX tabs:
1. Puzzle: Will show a puzzle only when you reach the correct destination. Solving puzzles will unlock clues for next destination. Solving a correct puzzle earns you 20 galleons! Wrong entry deducts 5 galleons.
2. Clues: Gives you up to 3 clues about the next destination. 1st clue will be free free free! 2nd clue will cost you 5 galleons. Third one will be for 10 galleons. If you can't solve further, leave the game loser!
3. Maps: Maps tab will show you your current location! Hurray! But every time you use the maps tab, expect to lose 20 freakin' galleons!
4. Score: Displays your current galleons left and the time elapsed. Also shows the scores of your matey's playin' nearby.
5. Rules: Aren't you already in it!
6. Facts: Fun facts about your map for your nerdy brain.
